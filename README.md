## CONJUGATE GRADIENT

This code implements CONJUGATE GRADIENT to minimize the potential energy of a system of 
soft-spheres. The code is divided into two parts where the conj_grad.cpp is the conjugate 
gradient part which contains no code specific to the system that is being optimized and 
soft_sphere.cpp	which contains the system specific code. 

Conjugate gradient algorithm is described in detail in
