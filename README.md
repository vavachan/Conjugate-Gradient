## CONJUGATE GRADIENT

This code implements CONJUGATE GRADIENT to minimize the potential energy of a system of 
soft-spheres. The code is divided into two parts where the conj_grad.cpp is the conjugate 
gradient part which contains no code specific to the system that is being optimized and 
soft_sphere.cpp	which contains the system specific code. 

Conjugate gradient algorithm is described in detail in 
[Jacobs, Donald J., and Bruce Hendrickson. "An algorithm for two-dimensional rigidity percolation: the pebble game." Journal of Computational Physics 137.2 (1997): 346-365.][1]

[This lecture from MIT Opencourseware by Dr Erik Demaine gives an excellent explanation of the algorithm][2]
